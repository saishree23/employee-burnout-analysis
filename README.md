Employee Burnout Prediction and Analysis

The problem at hand is to develop a robust and accurate predictive model that can analyze and predict employees' burnout levels in an organization. Burnout refers to a state of chronic work-related stress that leads to exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy. The goal is to use machine learning and AI techniques to process and analyze employee data to determine their burnout levels and provide meaningful predictions for future burnout risks.
GOAL:
Create an AI model capable of analyzing employee data to assess burnout levels.
Develop a predictive model that can forecast potential burnout risks for employees.
Provide actionable insights to organizations to address and manage employee burnout effectively.
Enhance employee well-being, job satisfaction, and overall organizational productivity.
DATASET:
The project uses a carefully curated dataset that contains various employee-related features such as work hours, stress levels, job roles, and burnout scores. The dataset has been preprocessed and anonymized to ensure data privacy and security.
We have evaluated the performance of the AI model on various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.Additionally, we have created visualizations to better understand the model's predictions and its impact on employee burnout levels.
